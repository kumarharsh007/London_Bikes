# London Bikes Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and data files for a data analysis project focused on London bike-sharing data. The project utilizes Python for data preprocessing, analysis while Tableau is used for visualizing insights derived from the data. The goal of this project is to analyze patterns, trends, and user behaviors within the London bike-sharing system.

## Project Components
- **Python Scripts**: Python scripts are used for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Tableau Visualizations**: Tableau is employed to create interactive visualizations that showcase the analyzed data and insights in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.
- **Data Files**: This repository contains the dataset(s) used for the analysis.

## Project Structure
- **`python/`**: This directory contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, EDA.
- **`tableau/`**: Contains Tableau workbooks and visualization files.
- **`data/`**: This directory contains the dataset(s) used for the analysis.
- **`README.md`**: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use the code and reproduce the analysis.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kumarharsh007/London_Bikes.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for running the Python scripts.

3. **Explore the Data**: Navigate to the `data/` directory and explore the dataset(s) provided.

4. **Run Python Scripts**: Execute the Python scripts in the `python/` directory for data preprocessing, EDA.

5. **Visualize Data with Tableau**: Open the Tableau workbooks provided in the `tableau/` directory to explore the visualizations.
